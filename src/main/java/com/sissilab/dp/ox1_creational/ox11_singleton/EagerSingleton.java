 * Pros:

 * 3. no performance overhead during `getInstance()`, as the instance is created at the time of class loading

 * 3. inflexible to handle exceptions during the class creation using static constant

 * Best Use Cases:
 * 1. Use it when the singleton class is relatively lightweight.
 * 2. Use it when the singleton class is frequently needed during the application's lifecycle.
